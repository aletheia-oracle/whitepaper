# Aletheia Whitepaper

This is repository for the whitepaper of the aletheia decentralized inflation oracle. 

It's heavily WIP. 

The document is best viewed on Roam Research, leveraging the use of block references and other Roam Research's features. 

To colab, it's best to use GitHub issues to discuss about possible changes. After deliberation, the changes will be applied to the Roam Research whitepaper. 

For ease of use, the whitepaper is mirrored on GitHub using HackMD.
